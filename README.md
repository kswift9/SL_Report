# SL_Report
First Assignment for CS 7641

To run this code, save all files in the same directory. 
- sl_utils.py contains the classes and methods I used to download data from Kaggle and run my experiments.
- requirements.txt contain all necesarry packages your environment must have installed
- Run all on SL_Report_Analysis to perform the pre-processing I describe in my report and create models
- AFTER running SL_Report_Analysis, you can run SL_Report_Competition, which is where I make the naive models in my "Additional Analysis" section
- SL_Report_EDA is a loose assortment of code I used for EDA and to make some figures in the report
